#### Profile: ccproxy-api

**Comprehensive Analysis**

**Overview:**
ccproxy-api is a reverse proxy that lets Claude Max subscribers use the API without separate billing. This is a fascinating niche that Pensieve could serve.

**Technical Details:**
- **Repository:** https://github.com/CaddyGlow/ccproxy-api
- **Purpose:** Claude Max subscription → API access
- **Install:** `uvx ccproxy-api` or `pipx run ccproxy-api`

**How It Works:**

**Two Modes:**

1. **SDK Mode (/sdk):**
   - Routes through local claude-code-sdk
   - Access to MCP tools configured in Claude environment
   - Integrated permission management

2. **API Mode (/api):**
   - Direct reverse proxy
   - Injects authentication headers
   - Transparent passthrough

**Translation Layer:**
Supports both Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible API formats for requests and responses, including streaming.

**Why This Exists:**
- Claude Max subscription ($20/month) doesn't include API access
- API has separate billing (pay-per-token)
- Power users want to leverage Max subscription for API usage
- ccproxy bridges this gap

**Pensieve Positioning:**

**Competitive Advantage:**
Pensieve is simpler than ccproxy + Claude Max:
- No subscription needed ($20/month savings)
- No proxy complexity
- Direct API server
- Better privacy (no Anthropic servers involved)

**But ccproxy reveals user needs:**
1. Want to use subscription for API access
2. Need OpenAI format compatibility (translation layer)
3. Want MCP tool integration
4. Value Claude Code SDK features

**Integration Opportunities:**

**1. OpenAI Format Support:**
Pensieve could add `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint alongside `/v1/messages`:
```python
# Currently: Anthropic format only
POST http://127.0.0.1:7777/v1/messages

# Could add: OpenAI format
POST http://127.0.0.1:7777/v1/chat/completions
```
This would make Pensieve compatible with all OpenAI-based tools too.

**2. MCP Integration:**
Pensieve could support Model Context Protocol:
- Tool definitions
- Function calling
- Context providers

**3. Dual API Compatibility:**
Like ccproxy, Pensieve could serve both API formats simultaneously.

**Market Insight:**
The existence of ccproxy shows:
- Users creatively solve API access problems
- There's demand for flexible API solutions
- Translation layers are valuable
- Privacy concerns drive local solutions

**Recommendation:**
Study ccproxy's translation layer. Consider adding OpenAI-compatible endpoint to Pensieve for maximum tool compatibility.

                    │ (Fallback)   │
                    └──────────────┘
```

**Smart Routing:**
Pensieve could intelligently route:
- Simple queries → Local model (fast, free)
- Complex queries → OpenAI API (capability)
- Sensitive code → Local model (privacy)
- Public questions → OpenAI API (cost-effective)

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
pensieve_config:
  local_model:
    path: ./models/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct-4bit
    enabled: true

  routing:
    default: local
    fallback: openai

    rules:
      - condition: token_count > 50000
        route: openai
      - condition: contains_code
        route: local  # Privacy
      - condition: task_type == "reasoning"
        route: openai  # GPT-4 better at reasoning
```

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct API Replacement

**Mechanism:** Change `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` environment variable

**Applicable Tools:**
- Aider
- Cline
- Continue.dev
- LangChain
- Raycast
- Mentat
- codecompanion.nvim
- gptel

**Advantages:**
- Zero code changes
- Works immediately
- Standard pattern
- Easy to document

**Implementation:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7777
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy-key

# Tool now uses Pensieve
aider
```

**Documentation Template:**
```markdown
# Using [TOOL] with Pensieve

1. Start Pensieve server:
   ```bash
   ./pensieve start --model ./models/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct-4bit/model.safetensors
   ```

2. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7777
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy
   ```

3. Run [TOOL] normally:
   ```bash
   [tool-command]
   ```

All API requests now go to Pensieve instead of Anthropic servers.
```

---

### Pattern 2: Configuration File

**Mechanism:** Edit tool's config file to point to custom endpoint

**Applicable Tools:**
- Continue.dev (config.json)
- LiteLLM (litellm_config.yaml)
- Open WebUI (settings)
- Plandex (provider config)

**Advantages:**
- Persistent configuration
- Per-project settings
- Version-controllable (team sync)
- Multiple profiles (local vs. cloud)

**Example (Continue.dev):**
```json
{
  "models": [{
    "title": "Claude Local",
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    "apiKey": "dummy",
    "apiBase": "http://127.0.0.1:7777"
  }]
}
```

**Example (LiteLLM):**
```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: claude-local
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229
      api_base: http://127.0.0.1:7777
      api_key: dummy
  - model_name: claude-cloud
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229
      api_key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
```

---

### Pattern 3: Proxy/Gateway Integration

**Mechanism:** Pensieve sits behind universal proxy (LiteLLM, ccproxy)

**Advantages:**
- Routing logic (smart fallback)
- Monitoring/observability
- Authentication/authorization
- Multi-model support

**Architecture:**
```
┌──────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│ Application  │──────▶│  LiteLLM    │──────▶│  Pensieve    │
│ (any tool)   │       │   Proxy     │       │  (local)     │
└──────────────┘       └─────────────┘       └──────────────┘
                              │
                              └──────────────▶┌──────────────┐
                                              │ Claude API   │
                                              │ (fallback)   │
                                              └──────────────┘
```

**Routing Rules Example:**
```python
# LiteLLM routing logic
if query.contains_code or query.is_sensitive:
    route_to = "pensieve"  # Privacy
elif query.tokens > 100000:
    route_to = "claude-api"  # Large context
elif query.complexity == "high":
    route_to = "claude-api"  # Quality
else:
    route_to = "pensieve"  # Cost savings
```

---

### Pattern 4: Docker Compose Stack

**Mechanism:** Pre-configured multi-container deployment

**Applicable Use Cases:**
- Team deployments
- Enterprise installations
- Educational workshops
- Self-hosting enthusiasts

**Example Stack:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  pensieve:
    image: pensieve-server:latest
    container_name: pensieve
    ports:
      - "7777:7777"
    volumes:
      - ./models:/models
    command: >
      --model /models/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct-4bit/model.safetensors
      --host 0.0.0.0
      --port 7777

  open-webui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    container_name: open-webui
    ports:
      - "3000:8080"
    environment:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_BASE=http://pensieve:7777
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy
    depends_on:
      - pensieve

  langfuse:
    image: langfuse/langfuse:latest
    container_name: langfuse-observer
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

networks:
  default:
    name: pensieve-stack
```

**Benefits:**
- One-command deployment: `docker-compose up`
- Reproducible setup
- Easy to share/distribute
- Includes monitoring/UI

---

### Pattern 5: Smart Hybrid (Cloud + Local)

**Mechanism:** Intelligent routing between Pensieve and Claude API

**Use Cases:**
1. **Development:** Local (Pensieve)
2. **Production:** Cloud (Claude API)
3. **Sensitive data:** Local
4. **Public data:** Cloud (potentially cheaper with scale)

**Implementation Approaches:**

**A. Environment-based:**
```python
import os

if os.getenv("ENV") == "production":
    api_base = "https://api.anthropic.com"
else:
    api_base = "http://127.0.0.1:7777"
```

**B. Content-based:**
```python
def get_api_endpoint(prompt):
    if contains_sensitive_data(prompt):
        return "http://127.0.0.1:7777"  # Local
    elif is_simple_query(prompt):
        return "http://127.0.0.1:7777"  # Local (fast)
    else:
        return "https://api.anthropic.com"  # Cloud (quality)
```

**C. Cost-optimized:**
```python
monthly_budget = 100  # dollars
spent_this_month = get_api_costs()

if spent_this_month > monthly_budget * 0.8:
    # Approaching budget, switch to local
    return "http://127.0.0.1:7777"
else:
    return "https://api.anthropic.com"
```

---

### Pattern 6: Plugin/Extension Model

**Mechanism:** Pensieve as plugin to existing tool

**Examples:**
