# Steering Documents Directory (.steeringDocs/)

This directory contains project-level guidance documents that steer the development of the Pensieve local LLM server.

## Purpose

The `.steeringDocs/` folder contains high-level project documentation that provides direction and guidance for development, architecture decisions, and project management.

## Document Types

### Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**File:** `PRD.md`

Defines what the project should accomplish:
- Problem statements and objectives
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Success criteria and metrics
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Timeline and milestones

### Architecture Document
**File:** `Architecture.md`

Describes how the system should be built:
- High-level system architecture
- Component breakdown and responsibilities
- Technology stack and design patterns
- Data flow and interactions
- Performance and security considerations

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
**Files:** `ADR-*.md`

Captures important architectural decisions:
- Context and problem statement
- Decision rationale and alternatives considered
- Consequences and trade-offs
- Implementation guidance
- Related decisions

## Directory Structure

├── README.md                    # This file
├── PRD.md                      # Product Requirements Document
├── Architecture.md             # System Architecture
├── ADR-Template.md            # ADR Template
├── ADR-001-workspace-structure.md    # Decision on workspace organization
├── ADR-002-async-framework.md        # Decision on async framework
└── ADR-XXX-...                       # Additional ADRs
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating New ADRs
1. Copy the template: `cp ADR-Template.md ADR-XXX-[title].md`
2. Update the number (use next sequential number)
3. Fill in the content following the template format
4. Update status as the decision progresses
5. Link related ADRs using cross-references

### Document Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep documents current with project evolution
- **Version Control**: All changes tracked in git history
- **Review Process**: Regular reviews to ensure alignment
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all team members can access and understand

### Integration with Development
- **Before Implementation**: Check steering documents for guidance
- **During Development**: Reference architecture and requirements
- **After Implementation**: Update documents based on learnings
- **Decision Making**: Create ADRs for significant decisions

## Document Lifecycle

### PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- **Initial**: Draft based on project goals
- **Review**: Team review and feedback
- **Approval**: Stakeholder sign-off
- **Updates**: As requirements evolve
- **Archive**: When project is complete or requirements change significantly

### Architecture Document
- **Draft**: Initial architecture proposal
- **Review**: Technical review and validation
- **Refinement**: Based on feedback and constraints
- **Updates**: As architecture evolves
- **Decommission**: When replaced by new architecture

### ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- **Proposed**: Initial decision proposal
- **Accepted**: Decision finalized and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision superseded by new approach
- **Superseded**: Explicitly replaced by another ADR

## Collaboration

### Document Review Process
1. **Author**: Create or update document
2. **Review**: Team review period
3. **Comments**: Provide feedback and suggestions
4. **Revision**: Address feedback
5. **Approval**: Final approval for implementation

### Change Management
- Significant changes require new ADRs
- Update existing documents for minor changes
- Maintain change history in document headers
- Communicate changes to the team

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Planning Phase
- Review PRD for requirements
- Check Architecture for constraints
- Review relevant ADRs for context

### Implementation Phase
- Follow architectural patterns
- Implement according to requirements
- Create new ADRs for significant decisions

### Review Phase
- Validate implementation against steering documents
- Update documents based on implementation learnings
- Share insights with the team

## Best Practices

### Document Quality
- **Clear and Concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **Actionable**: Provide concrete guidance
- **Up-to-Date**: Keep current with project state
- **Accessible**: Ensure all team members can understand

### Decision Making
- **Document Early**: Capture decisions as they happen
- **Include Context**: Explain the "why" behind decisions
- **Consider Alternatives**: Show due diligence in decision process
- **Track Consequences**: Monitor the impact of decisions
