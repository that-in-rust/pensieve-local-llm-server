But we do not need all this no



we need a task generator command which has 2 options

- if chunk size is not provided it is a file level - row analysis - so we need to create txt files for content contentL1 contentL2 - and then refere them in our task list as per row number 

- if chunk size provided then create TableName_ChunkSize table with rule such as A. If file LOC is less than ChunkSize then simply copy the row from TableName to TableName_ChunkSize B. if file LOC is bigger than ChunkSize then break it down into multiple rows. The L1 content would then be concatnation of row, row + 1 and row ; Content L2 will be concatenation of row, row +1 and row +2 contant. When the new table is created - simply create the txt files as in the initial case and generate the task list

task list should be in txt



create a new command call chunk-level-task-generator -- all other task generator commands wont work hence - do not delete their code yet - first build this - test this with our current tables htne we will do cleanup
