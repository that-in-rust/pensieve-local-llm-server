## üîß Implementation Details

### Core Structures

#### `ContentFileWriter`
- Main struct for async file I/O operations
- Uses `tokio::fs` for async file operations
- Configurable through `ContentWriteConfig`
- Supports concurrent file writing with configurable limits

#### `ContentWriteConfig`
- Builder pattern for flexible configuration
- Supports multiple naming patterns:
  - Table-based: `{table_name}_{row_number}_Content.txt`
  - File-based: `{filename}_{row_number}_Content.txt`
  - Custom: User-defined pattern with placeholders
- Configurable buffer sizes and concurrency limits
- Validation for configuration parameters

#### `ContentWriteResult`
- Comprehensive result tracking
- Performance metrics (processing time, throughput)
- File creation statistics
- Warning collection for non-fatal issues

### Key Methods

#### `write_content_files()`
- **Purpose**: Batch processing of database rows
- **Input**: Table name and list of `IngestedFile` records
- **Output**: Creates 3 files per row (content, contentL1, contentL2)
- **Features**:
  - Concurrent processing with configurable batch sizes
  - Automatic skipping of rows without content
  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
  - Performance tracking and statistics

#### `write_row_files()`
- **Purpose**: Individual row processing
- **Input**: Single `IngestedFile` record and row number
- **Output**: Creates content, L1, and L2 files for the row
- **Features**:
  - L1 context generation (content + L1 context marker)
  - L2 context generation (content + L2 context marker)
  - Proper file path generation based on naming pattern
  - Atomic file operations with error recovery

#### `write_chunked_content_files()`
- **Purpose**: Processing chunked file data
- **Input**: List of `ChunkedFile` records
- **Output**: Creates content files for each chunk
- **Features**:
  - Supports pre-computed L1/L2 context from chunking service
  - Batch processing with concurrency control
  - Chunk-specific file naming

### Error Handling

- Uses `TaskGeneratorError` and `TaskGeneratorResult` types
- Comprehensive error context with file paths and causes
- Graceful handling of I/O errors, permission issues, and disk space
- Non-fatal errors collected as warnings in results

### Performance Features

- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable batch sizes and concurrent writes
- **Buffered I/O**: Configurable buffer sizes for optimal performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming processing without loading all content in memory
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time statistics and performance metrics

## üß™ Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (15+ test cases)
1. **Configuration Tests**:
   - Builder pattern validation
   - Configuration validation (buffer size, concurrency)
   - Default value verification

2. **Naming Pattern Tests**:
   - Table-based naming
   - File-based naming  
   - Custom pattern with placeholders

3. **Content Generation Tests**:
   - L1 context generation
   - L2 context generation
   - Content validation

4. **File Operations Tests**:
   - Individual row processing
   - Batch processing
   - Empty content handling
   - File existence verification

5. **Async Operations Tests**:
   - Async file creation
   - Concurrent processing
   - Error handling in async context

6. **Performance Tests**:
   - Processing rate calculations
   - Throughput measurements
   - Memory usage validation

### Test Features
- Uses `tempfile` for isolated test environments
- Comprehensive async test coverage with `#[tokio::test]`
- Mock data generation for realistic testing
- File system verification (files created, content correct)
- Performance metric validation

## üîó Integration Points

### Database Integration
- Works with `IngestedFile` records from database service
- Supports both regular and chunked table processing
- Compatible with existing database models and error types

### Chunking Service Integration
- Processes `ChunkedFile` records from chunking service
- Preserves L1/L2 context computed during chunking
- Maintains chunk metadata and relationships

### Task Generation Integration
- Creates content files referenced by task generators
- Follows naming conventions compatible with task list generation
- Provides file paths for task metadata

## üìä Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: Configurable concurrent processing (default: 10 concurrent writes)
- **Memory Usage**: Streaming processing, minimal memory footprint
- **I/O Optimization**: Buffered writes (default: 64KB buffer)
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual file failures
- **Scalability**: Batch processing for large datasets

## üéØ Task Status: COMPLETED

All sub-tasks have been successfully implemented and tested:
- [x] Create `ContentFileWriter` struct with async file I/O operations
- [x] Implement `write_content_files()` method to create content, contentL1, contentL2 files
- [x] Implement `write_row_files()` method for individual row processing
- [x] Use `tokio::fs` for async file operations with proper error handling
- [x] Write unit tests for file creation and content validation

The implementation is ready for integration with the main chunk-level task generator and provides a solid foundation for content file generation in both file-level and chunk-level processing modes.
