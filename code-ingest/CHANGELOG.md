  - Automated installation script for multiple platforms
  - Docker support for containerized deployment
  - Homebrew formula for macOS installation
  - Comprehensive setup documentation

### Technical Details

- **Languages**: Rust 1.70+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 12+
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `clap` for CLI argument parsing
  - `tokio` for async runtime
  - `sqlx` for PostgreSQL integration
  - `git2` for repository operations
  - `serde` for serialization
  - `anyhow`/`thiserror` for error handling

- **Architecture**: 
  - Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
  - Trait-based dependency injection for testability
  - RAII resource management
  - Streaming processing pipeline

- **Performance Contracts**:
  - File processing: >100 files/second for typical text files
  - Query response: <1 second for repositories with 10,000+ files
  - Memory usage: <100MB peak during ingestion
  - Database growth: <2x source repository size including indexes

### Known Limitations

- Binary file content extraction not supported (metadata only)
- Limited to PostgreSQL database backend
- External tool dependencies for document conversion
- Single-machine deployment only (no distributed processing)

### Security Considerations

- GitHub token handling through environment variables
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input validation for all user-provided data
- Secure temporary file handling

## [0.0.1] - 2024-09-01

### Added
- Initial project structure
- Basic file classification prototype
- PostgreSQL schema design
- Core CLI framework

## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - "Foundation Release"

This initial release establishes code-ingest as a comprehensive solution for transforming GitHub repositories into queryable PostgreSQL databases. The system is designed for developers who need to quickly understand unfamiliar codebases through systematic analysis.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and recovery mechanisms
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed with streaming processing and parallel execution
- **Developer Friendly**: Rich CLI interface with extensive documentation and examples
- **Extensible**: Clean architecture supporting future enhancements and integrations
- **Well Tested**: >90% test coverage with multiple testing strategies

**Use Cases Supported:**
- New developer onboarding and codebase exploration
- Security auditing and vulnerability assessment
- Architecture documentation and system understanding
- Code quality analysis and technical debt identification
- Research and academic analysis of software projects

**Getting Started:**
```bash
# Install code-ingest
cargo install code-ingest

# Set up PostgreSQL
code-ingest pg-start

# Ingest your first repository
code-ingest ingest https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook --db-path ./analysis

# Start exploring
code-ingest sql "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM INGEST_*" --db-path ./analysis
```
