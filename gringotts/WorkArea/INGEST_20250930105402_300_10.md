# High-PMF Rust Use Cases Analysis

## Analysis Framework: L1-L8 Extraction Hierarchy

### A Alone: Systematic Use Case Evaluation

This document presents a comprehensive analysis of 50+ high Product-Market Fit (PMF) use cases for Rust libraries and tools, systematically evaluated for implementation ease and market potential. Each use case includes PMF probability scores and implementation guidance.

**Key Insights from A:**
- **Systematic Evaluation**: Quantified PMF probability and ease of testing scores
- **Diverse Domains**: React tooling, WASM optimization, systems programming, and more
- **Implementation Ready**: Clear 5-line descriptions and parallel comparisons
- **Market Validation**: Focus on proven pain points with existing market demand

### Strategic Recommendations

This analysis provides a prioritized roadmap for Rust library development, focusing on high-impact opportunities with clear market validation and implementation pathways.
