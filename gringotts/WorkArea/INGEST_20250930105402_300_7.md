# Minimalist Rust Utilities Pre-Development Specification

## Analysis Framework: L1-L8 Extraction Hierarchy

### A Alone: Comprehensive Project Blueprint Collection

This document provides complete pre-development specifications for 15+ small-scale Rust utilities, each with detailed PRDs, user journey maps, and architectural diagrams. It emphasizes the "Ergonomic Advantage" principle - tools that fundamentally enhance developer workflows.

**Key Insights from A:**
- **Systematic Framework**: Standardized PRD + User Journey + Architecture approach
- **Ergonomic Focus**: Tools designed for superior developer experience, not just functionality
- **Practical Scope**: Each project constrained to <300 LOC for rapid development
- **Complete Specifications**: Ready-to-implement blueprints with clear acceptance criteria

### Strategic Recommendations

This represents a comprehensive collection of implementable Rust utility specifications, focusing on developer experience improvements over existing tools. Each specification includes complete implementation guidance.
